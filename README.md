# freecad-mcp

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for FreeCAD parametric 3D CAD modeling. Provides 165 tools across 15 modules for document management, primitives, booleans, sketching, part design, meshing, FEM, BIM, and more.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18
- [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) 0.21 or later installed

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sergiudanstan/freecad-mcp.git
cd freecad-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

## Setup

The server supports two modes: **GUI mode** (recommended) and **headless mode** (fallback).

### GUI Mode (recommended)

GUI mode connects to a running FreeCAD instance so you can see changes live in the 3D viewport.

**Step 1 — Start the FreeCAD socket server macro:**

1. Open FreeCAD
2. Go to **Macro > Macros...**
3. Click **"..."** (browse) and navigate to the `freecad_server.FCMacro` file in this repo
4. Select it and click **Execute**
5. You should see in the FreeCAD console:
   ```
   MCP Socket Server listening on 127.0.0.1:12345
   MCP Server macro loaded. Waiting for connections...
   ```

The macro must be running **before** the MCP server connects. The server auto-detects the socket on startup.

**Step 2 — Configure your MCP client:**

Add the server to your MCP client configuration. For Claude Code, add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freecad": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/freecad-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or via the CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add freecad node /path/to/freecad-mcp/dist/index.js
```

### Headless Mode (fallback)

If FreeCAD GUI is not running, the server automatically falls back to headless mode using `freecadcmd`. This works for scripting and automation but you won't see visual output.

The server looks for `freecadcmd` at `/Applications/FreeCAD.app/Contents/Resources/bin/freecadcmd` by default. Override with:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freecad": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/freecad-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "FREECAD_CMD": "/your/path/to/freecadcmd"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Security

- All inputs are validated at runtime (numeric ranges, string sanitization, path traversal prevention)
- File operations block access to system paths (`/etc/`, `/proc/`, etc.)
- The `freecad_execute_python` tool allows arbitrary Python execution by design — only use in trusted environments
- The GUI socket server listens only on localhost (`127.0.0.1:12345`)
